# 🌍 Carbon Emission Analysis – DBMS Project

Hey there! This is a simple web project I built using PHP and MySQL to store and analyze carbon emission data. It helped me understand how CRUD operations work in real life and how to make data a little more visual and meaningful.

## 💡 What This Project Does

🔹 **Add Emission Data**  
Users can enter details like:
- Source (e.g., fuel, electricity, etc.)
- Amount of carbon emitted (in kg)
- Date and Country

🔹 **View and Manage Records**  
All entered data is displayed in a table. Features include:
- Edit and delete existing records
- Filter by country or year
- View total and average emissions

🔹 **Data Visualization**
- 📈 Line chart to show carbon trends over time  
- 🥧 Pie chart to display emission breakdown by source

## 🔧 Tech Used

- **Frontend** – HTML + CSS (basic)
- **Backend** – PHP (XAMPP)
- **Database** – MySQL (phpMyAdmin)
- **Charts** – Chart.js

## 🙋‍♀️ A Little About Me

I’m **Sri Gayathri S**, currently pursuing B.Tech in **AI & Data Science**. This was one of my first DBMS-based web projects, and working on it made me even more excited about using tech for environmental awareness and real-world problem solving.
